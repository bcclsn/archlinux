Microphone not detected by PulseAudio

Determine the card and device number of your mic:

 $ arecord -l
 **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC269VC Analog [ALC269VC Analog]
 Subdevices: 1/1
 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

In hw:CARD,DEVICE notation, you would specify the above device as hw:0,0.

Then, edit /etc/pulse/default.pa and insert a load-module line specifying your device as follows:

  load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:0,0
  # the line above should be somewhere before the line below
 .ifexists module-udev-detect.so

Finally, restart pulseaudio to apply the new settings:

  $ pulseaudio -k ; pulseaudio -D

If everything worked correctly, you should now see your mic show up when running pavucontrol (under the Input Devices tab).
